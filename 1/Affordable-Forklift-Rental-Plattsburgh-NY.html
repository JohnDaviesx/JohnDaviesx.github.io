<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture. One of the key features of this type of forklift is that they are counterbalanced â€” meaning that the battery also functions as a counterweight for stability. Optimize your storage capacity by operating in narrow aisles at high picking levels with Raymond Orderpicker trucks.</p>
<p>Our Lorry Loader training course (HIAB) delivered by Lift A Load Training ensures successful candidates have the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating a lorry loader. These high performers from brands such as Mitsubishi , Heli , Toyota , Hyster and Yale are ready for any stacking, moving, lifting or handling job you may have, whether indoor or outdoor.</p>

Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents.

We are a well-known manufacturer, exporter, wholesaler, distributor and supplier of Full Electric Pallet Truck, which is an efficient performing product of our company.

The larger ground clearance allows you to install larger tires and perhaps the best part of all is that your truck will handle the same or better than it did before depending on the type of kit you install.
