<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>With a broad range of capabilities, these forklifts can adapt to a variety of warehouse environments and are designed to help you run a faster, smoother operation.

The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>13 Low lift trucks may be operated by a person seated on the machine, or by a person walking alongside, depending on the design. Rough terrain forklifts use a telescopic or a standard mast, which can be quite handy when handling a complex-mix of reach and lift.
