Toyota's 7-series reach truck offers the industry's first AC Power System,along with Traction & Brake Control which gives improved traction, better braking and suspension control for more stability.

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>The 3,500 lb. 4-wheel electric forklift is very similar to the 3,000 lb. The battery is the same size, as is the frame. BYD lithium battery forklifts have been promoted by annual sales of 10,000 units; Anhui HeLi, Hangcha Group, EP Equipment, Noblelift, Ningbo Ruyi and Tailift have without exception produced their own lithium battery forklifts.
