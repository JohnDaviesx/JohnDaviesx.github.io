Our product range includes a wide range of manual hand pallet trucks, hydraulic hand pallet trucks, high lift pallet truck, rough terrain pallet truck, heavy duty pallet truck and rough terrain pallet trucks.

<h3>High Reach Forklift La Grange IL</h3>
<p>Further, the association also contribute to training the forklift operators as per the regulations imposed by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to reduce accidents. That's the first time more than a quarter-million units were sold in one year in North America, according to Brian Feehan, president of the Industrial Truck Association, the trade group representing lift truck manufacturers.</p>
<p>Given their job description and different types of conditions to deal with, order pickers need to be OSHA compliant with their training. Short Term forklift rental solutions can help you react immediately to a situation with a predicted cost. In a changing and fluctuating market, the rough-terrain forklift and telehandler sector is not without its challenges.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>
