It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>
<p>Types include two-wheeled hand trucks, which require the load to be tilted during travel; three-or-more wheeled dollies have a platform but no handle, so the load is pushed; and manually-pushed floor hand trucks or carts that ride on four-or-more wheels and may or may not have a hitch for pulling or a handle for pushing. Prior to 2011 all States and Territories of Australia independently regulated occupational health and safety in that state, including forklift licensing.</p>
