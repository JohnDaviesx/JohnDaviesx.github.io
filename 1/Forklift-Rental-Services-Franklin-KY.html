<h3>Material Handling Lift, Capacity Franklin KY 42134</h3>
<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air.
