Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Reach forklifts exemplify these features as they can reach higher storage levels than standard models and have a better control response time. Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.

Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
