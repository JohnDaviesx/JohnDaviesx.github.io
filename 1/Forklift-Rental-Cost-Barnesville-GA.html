<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>The pallet jack also features a durable sealed pump with overload safety system. A forklift is any mechanical device, powered by an electric motor or internal combustion engine that is used to move or lift loads.
