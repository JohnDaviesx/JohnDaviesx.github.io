Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
<p>Some new equipment dealerships may have used forklifts that were part of a trade-in. Sometimes the outriggers on a standard walkie reach truck can get in the way of picking loads up.
