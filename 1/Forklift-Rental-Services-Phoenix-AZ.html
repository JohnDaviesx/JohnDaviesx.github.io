Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>

The operator should never use the forklift as a personal lift unless wearing the proper harness and safety equipment.
