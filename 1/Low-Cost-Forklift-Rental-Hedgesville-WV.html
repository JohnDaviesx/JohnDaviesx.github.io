Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>

Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor.
