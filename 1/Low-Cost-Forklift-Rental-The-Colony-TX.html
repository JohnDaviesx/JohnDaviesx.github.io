<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift.

In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>
