<p>At Frank Kent CDJR, we have used lifted trucks for sale, and our expert service staff can install lift kits into one of our new or used pickups for you. For instance, KION North America Corp., Summerville, S.C., released three new Linde electric pallet trucks delivering load capacities of 2,600-4,500 pounds. Buying diesel forklifts are the other option and are easy to refuel.</p>

<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both.

Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties.
