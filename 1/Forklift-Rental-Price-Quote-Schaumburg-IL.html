<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road. We handle all major brands, makes, models, years and everything from an electric pallet jack to larger trucks. Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine.</p>

<p>However, only the forklift truck manufacturer can give accurate lifting capacities. Lifted trucks look right at home on any beach, and their increased performance makes traversing sand more satisfying than an ocean breeze.

<p>Still, gas forklifts are more popular for many outdoors jobs. Compact and high powered reach trucks of 1.3ton up to 2.5ton capacity offer fast response, easy operation and smooth load handling for high-density warehouse handling efficiency. Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
