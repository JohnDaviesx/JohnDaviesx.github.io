<h3>Doosan Forklift Niantic CT</h3>
<p>While standard counterbalance forklifts need a good amount of space to make turns, a three-wheel forklift can actually spin in a very tight circle.

They work closely with independently-owned equipment rental yards, bringing everything together in one place.</p>
<p>Our manoeuvrable and versatile EFG counterbalance forklift trucks are designed for maximum performance at minimum energy consumption: latest generation 3-phase AC motors, highest efficiency thanks to PureEnergy concept, productivity-enhancing ergonomics and optimum safety.

My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
