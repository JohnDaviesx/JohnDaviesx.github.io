<p>The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team. The China Pallet Trucks market holds a major value share in the global market and is likely maintain its dominance in the global Pallet Trucks market over the forecast period. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load, and with the load elevated 12 inches from the test platform, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels, and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction because in order to install a lift kit, the truck's body and frame must be separate. We have seen that business owners who use a hand pallet truck give much productivity per day. This machine is designed with a low stowed height to allow for superior maneuverability through entryways. Raymond stand up and sit down forklifts come equipped with exclusive features and technologies, delivering superior visibility, exceptional ergonomics, and unmatched efficiency.</p>
