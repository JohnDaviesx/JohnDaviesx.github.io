<p>This motor does the work of lifting the load and moving the hand truck. Powered High-Lift Trucks: Order-Picker Safety is a complete package that tends to all safety needs of order-pickers and drivers and will help keep your facility incident-free in its daily operational use of powered high-lift trucks.

OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
