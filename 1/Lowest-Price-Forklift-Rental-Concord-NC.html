<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
