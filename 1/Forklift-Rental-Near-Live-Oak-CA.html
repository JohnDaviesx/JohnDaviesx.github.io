Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>On the basis of end use, the global Pallet Trucks market can be segmented into food & beverage, retail stores, wholesale distribution, freight & logistics and manufacturing and others.
