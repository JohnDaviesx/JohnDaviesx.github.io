Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks.

<p>The primary difference between class 5 models of class 4 are the tires each IC forklift equip. Alternate capacities may be established at the same specified load center and at less than maximum elevation of the load engaging means. Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>
<p>Pickup trucks offer different levels of functionality and performance for different drivers - that flexibility and power is what a lot of people love about trucks.
