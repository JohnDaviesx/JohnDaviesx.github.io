<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

<p>Knowing an accurate weight of the material being handled is crucial to the safe operation of your lift truck. A forklift is made out of a fork, a control unit, a motor and a counterweight.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>

<p>Handle only loads within the rated capacity of the truck. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator.
