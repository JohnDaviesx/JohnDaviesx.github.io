<p>Designed to increase productivity when handling heavy loads, the innovative and unique BT Pro Lifter model LHM230P requires up to 67% less force than a standard hand pallet truck to begin moving. Pallet jacks - also called order pickers, typical pallet jacks can lift approximately 3,300 pounds. DaytonÂ® pallet trucks feature a cushion grip with a 3-position lever and a flow valve for controlled lowering.</p>
<p>Unless you are very experienced and know what to look for when inspecting a forklift, have a qualified mechanic or knowledgeable operator carry out the inspection. An alert worker should know to look out for people standing close to the forklift or walking toward it. Also, carrying a passenger on the truck sometimes leads to injury. OSHA defines a powered industrial truck (PIT) as any mobile, power-propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, whether ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator.</p>
<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
