<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town.
