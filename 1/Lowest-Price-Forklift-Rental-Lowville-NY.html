Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>

Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>
