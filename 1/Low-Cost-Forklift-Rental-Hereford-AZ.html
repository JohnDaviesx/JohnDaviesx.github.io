The handle shall be mounted in such manner that the operator will steer with his left hand when facing the load end of the truck. The telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift is generally manufactured in separate, functional group sections: hydraulics, powertrain (engine, transmission, etc.), electrical, chassis, and boom.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Many countries and regions require fork lift operator training and, in some cases, a fork lift operator license, due to the potentially dangerous nature of the work and the high value of merchandise handled by lifts. Push the handle down to pump up the pallet jack, then let the handle come back using the mechanical spring.
