We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one. Overall, a sit-down forklift is the right call for operations that need several hours of forklift work a day, or need to put their operator's comfort, safety, and accessibility first.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use.
