<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. Keep these statistics in mind while training workers and safely operating forklifts. This additional clearance requires installing larger tires and in order to do that, you need to get everything up off the ground more. Yale Materials Handling Corporation markets a full line of materials handling lift truck products and services, including electric, gas, LP-gas and diesel powered lift trucks; narrow aisle, very narrow aisle and motorized hand trucks.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.‚Äù This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>

Our professional, capable staff can help you choose the best truck for your needs, and we provide comprehensive support for our lines as well as almost every other make of lift truck on the market.

<p>While maintaining a small turning radius, the P Series machines are built to a 22,000-pound capacity, and even larger as specifically required. Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>
<p>Beyond that, many workers can also be injured when (1) lift trucks are inadvertently driven off loading docks; (2) lifts fall between docks and an unsecured trailer; (3) they are struck by a lift truck; or (4) they fall while on elevated pallets and tines. While gas forklift types do not need to charge and can operate day or night as long as they have enough fuel, battery operated forklifts need to be properly charged for up to eight hours to be used at maximum capacity.</p>
