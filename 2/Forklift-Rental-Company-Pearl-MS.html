<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering.

<h2>Material Handling Lifts At Best Price In Pearl </h2>
<p>We are a leading Manufacturer of pallet truck and pharmaceutical industry pallet truck from Chennai, India. More modern type uses a hand pumped hydraulic jack to lift. Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines. Well, if it's style you're after, it's hard to beat a '17 Super Duty, even with a mild 6” lift on it. Already, when properly equipped, the truck has massive amounts of potential to look mean; painted heavy-duty bumpers with lights and winches, buff rims and aggressive tires will put you into a class of trucks a cut above.</p>

Our company also offers a range of pallet trucks. A electric forklift (also called lift truck, jitney, fork truck, fork hoist, and forklift truck) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials over short distances.</p>

For a full 25-foot (7.6 m) forward reach, the load capacity of this forklift is reduced to 2,000 pounds (908 kg) without outriggers, or stabilizing legs, and 3,250 pounds (148 kg) with outriggers.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Whether you're considering a lifted truck for work, pleasure, or both, there are some important benefits to think about as you get ready to decide what your next vehicle purchase should be. Size for size, diesel forklifts that are intended for outdoor use are generally the most powerful. Weight capacity is an important detail when planning your forklift rental because you do not want to pay for a rental only to find that it cannot safely lift the loads you need to handle.</p>
