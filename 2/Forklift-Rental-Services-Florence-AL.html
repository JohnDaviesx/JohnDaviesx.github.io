<p>Texas First Rentals will remain open during the COVID-19 outbreak to safely serve customers across our territory. For anyone interested in some serious off-roading, lifted trucks can be a great way to take your experience to the next level and conquer all-new trails. As a matter of fact, we specialize in bringing southern trucks to the midwest for all of our customers.

Our industrial reach forklift truck training course will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial reach forklift truck.</p>
<p>While the machine is designed to work on rough terrain, it isn't always set to work on all types of terrain. When you rent a forklift from Gregory Poole Lift Systems, you get the adaptability you need from your forklift fleet, without a huge impact on your bottom line. Many lifted truck owners purchased standard vehicles and later make modifications to them, either by themselves or with the help of a mechanic.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs.

One of our most popular and material handling equipment in demand is Electric Pallet Trucks. Highly versatile low-lift pallet skid handler for loads 3,000 - 8,000lbs. The electric forklift is a forklift truck powered by an electric motor instead of an internal combustion (IC) engine using either rechargeable industrial batteries or external ways of conveying power.</p>

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
