They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>

<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts are most optimal for outdoor construction and surfaces with difficult terrain. Forklifts are powered by electric battery or combustion engines. Today, rough terrain forklifts are a common sight on construction projects. Another safety feature that an electric reach stacker offers is an emergency reversing device in the handle. A forklift is a type of powered industrial truck” covered by OSHA standards.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're towing a heavy load, a lifted suspension provides the benefit of having more room to settle before the weight of the load bottoms out. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test # OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The new Toyota high capacity reach forklifts are developed for intensive stacking applications focusing on productivity, reliability, ergonomics (controls, steering and seat adapted to the driver's needs) and most importantly safety.</p>
