<p>The cost of renting a bucket truck will depend on the truck you're driving, the company, the working height, the geographical location and time you need it. The largest pricing factor, most of the time, will be the height limit. Most of the shipping firms now carry truck-mounted forklifts with them to easily off-load the construction products.

<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
