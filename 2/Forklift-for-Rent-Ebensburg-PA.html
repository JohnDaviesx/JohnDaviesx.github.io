With the innovative infrastructural unit, we are offering an inclusive assortment of High Lift Pallet Truck. Piggyback lifts - They are designed to lock on the back of delivery trucks for easy transportation to work sites as well as the smooth offloading of products.

<p>Most forklift dealerships rent their forklifts on daily, weekly and monthly contracts. We've engineered the H Series forklifts to be the best at both.

<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>If you are an adventurous individual or you just need a truck with significant size and power, then you definitely have to test drive one of our lifted trucks. The company builds 350,000 trucks each year, and their lowest lift weight is only 1,500 lbs while their heavy duty units can lift 100,000 lbs.
