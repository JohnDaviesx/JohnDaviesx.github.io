Built for the extreme, the WT Series platform pallet truck features a cast-steel reinforced chassis, up to 12 mm thick covers, die-cast aluminum handle and the toughest side restraints available.</p>

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components.
