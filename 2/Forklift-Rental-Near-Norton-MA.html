Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Safety features of this forklift truck include a high-visibility overhead guard, an emergency power disconnect switch, electric horn, and an anti-static ground strap.

<p>Some appreciate the appearance of the taller stance of these vehicles, while others like the enhanced view of the road from the extra ride height. For more information on what documentation you should have, both on site and in the office, see Rough Terrain Forklift Documentation” above. Though not quite as versatile as a skid steer loader, telehandlers and other rough terrain forklifts accept a number of attachments that boost both productivity and safety.</p>
