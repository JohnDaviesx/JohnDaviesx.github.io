Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>

Pallet jacks offer sturdy steel construction and often feature cushion grip handles for comfort. The occurrence of a major rollover accident is increased because lifted trucks have beefier suspensions that require greater travel than a more modest truck or one that is not lifted at all.</p>
