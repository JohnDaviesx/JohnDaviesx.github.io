Not move the truck and remain at the controls at all times, if operating an industrial lift truck with a forklift platform with an employee on the platform. For trucks with tilting forks, the forks shall be horizontal or at full upward tilt, whichever is less stable. If you work in a job that requires you to use a forklift primarily outdoors on natural or uneven terrain, even occasionally or rarely, you need rough terrain forklift training.</p>
<p>So while you may find cheaper custom trucks elsewhere, we doubt they'll compare to the quality you get from us. Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels. The wheels and tires are key components that set rough terrain forklifts apart from standard models.</p>

<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch. Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift.

Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties.
