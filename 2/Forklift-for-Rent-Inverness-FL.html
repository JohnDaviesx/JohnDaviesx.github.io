In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>

<p>Your rental supplier can provide you with operator training for an additional fee if you require this training for your drivers. Most rented forklifts include a full maintenance package that covers all consumables, repairs, etc. No matter what type of project, we'll find the forklift that's best suited to your needs. Suspension Lifts: For Pearland drivers searching for maximum lift, either for appearance enhancement or to survive on rugged terrain, a suspension lift is ideal.</p>
<p>To simulate an operator, a 200 pound weight should be located with the center of gravity centered 40 inches above the operator's platform.

<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
