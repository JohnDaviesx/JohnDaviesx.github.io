<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

<p>The lifting capacity of the pallet trucks and pallet lift trucks from Linde ranges from 500 to 3.300 kg.

Torcan Lift Equipment offers fast, well-bred and consistent Forklift Training & Rental Services in and around GTA since 1999.</p>
<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals.

<h2>Pallet Jack Parts Spring Hill</h2>
<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch. Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift. If you need help choosing a suspension kit for your vehicle, or can't find the kit your looking for, contact one of our mechanics.</p>
<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>Make that used custom lifted Ford F-150 or Toyota Tacoma yours with our help. Picking cases or single items from racks in a warehouse is the only job an order picker, a single-purpose lift truck, does. For moving unusually heavy loads manually, BT Heavy Lifter allows for safe and efficient handling with minimal effort. In addition to this, to meet the demands of our customers, we also customize this rental service as per their necessities.</p>
