<h2>Electric Stacker Great Barrington</h2>
<p>Forklifts are powered industrial trucks used to lift and move materials in short distances. Operators get excellent visibility with panoramic views of rack, loads and aisle. Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>

Ask about our Leave-A-Lift Program - we will leave a rental unit at your facility and you pay rent only for those times when you actually use the equipment.</p>
<p>When it is necessary to omit the overhead guard, special attention should be given by the user and operator to conditions such as height and stability of loads and stacks, weight of individual units, and operating space including overhead obstructions. Whether you use rough terrain forklifts every day or once in awhile, these machines can handle major wear and tear.</p>
<p>Our rental fleet - supplemented by over 5,000 lift trucks in Raymond's national network - is regularly updated with new equipment and maintained according to manufacturer's specifications. Our powered pallet trucks are easy to manoeuvre with load capacities up to 3t, perfect for material handling operations. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.</p>

<p>A simple phone call to Sun Equipment will initiate a discovery phone conversation where they will share their hands on knowledge of the business and guide you to the right used forklift for your needs. These trucks are great for loading and unloading pallets and balanced materials, well as removing and transporting items from delivery vehicles. Sometimes, your business might require a lift truck that can handle rough terrain and work outdoors.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
