<p>Choosing the right forklift for your business can be challenging and time consuming. How forklifts operate differently from a car. Their lift trucks start at 2,500 lbs weight lifts and go upwards of 125,000. For over 50 years, Liftking has grown to be the home of a complete line of Rough Terrain forklifts for both commercial and military clients. Stockpickers are used at elevations higher than the second level of racking in a warehouse or distribution center.</p>
<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>
