<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90Â° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>

They typically have pneumatic tyres that are larger than other types of forklifts and have maximum load capacities of between roughly 1,000 and 18,000 kilograms.</p>
<p>The maximum capacity of reach forklifts is generally around 5,000 pounds. The weight of the forklift's battery can also be used to provide stability to the truck, so any change in the type of battery for the forklift can lead to instability. The Hydraulic hand Pallet trucks can handle palletised load up to 2500 Kg in a single haul and a single operator can lift and move this weight effortlessly over short distances.</p>
<p>A slight variation on the walkie rider pallet jack, the operator stands in the middle of a center-controlled rider pallet jack. Counterbalanced forklifts have been a source of storage and handling systems, where they perform loading, stacking, distribution and horizontal transport functions.
