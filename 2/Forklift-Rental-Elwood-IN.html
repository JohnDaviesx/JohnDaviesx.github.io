<p>A rental can also serve as a test drive,” allowing you to test out different types of equipment to determine what you want to purchase. These permit the truck to drive over bumpy terrain without harming the vehicle's under-body. This abrasion can reduce the thickness of a fork until it cannot lift loads up to the designed capacity. Apart from this, a feedback of the spec sheet for Jungheinrich's 5000 lb. Electric counterbalanced truck shows that it has actually eclipsed the performance specifications of most internal combustion trucks.</p>
